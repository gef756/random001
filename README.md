Random Java exercise: How do you concatenate a List of Iterables taking all of
the first elements, then all of the second elements, etc.? For example, if you
have [[a, b, c, d], [e, f, g, h], [i, j, k]], where the outer brackets represent
a List, and the inner brackets are Iterables, how do you get this to return:
[a, e, i, b, f, j, c, g, k, d, h]?
